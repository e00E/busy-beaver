This repository contains various [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) code related to turing machines and the busy beaver function. It was inspired by the [Busy Beaver Challenge](https://bbchallenge.org/), which aims to find value of BB(5). This repository is not meant to be depended on by others. It is my personal playground.

Crates:
- busy_beaver: Library for general turing machine and busy beaver related code.
- seed:  Binary for generating Bbchallenge's seed database.

Some crates have their own Readme with more information.
